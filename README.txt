Readme
For our website, we have used the Real Meal Delivery which is an online food provider and has been in operation since 2002. They also have two takeout locations and they operate in Atlanta, GA.
For the website, we chose the colors that go with the logo of the Real Meal Delivery, so we chose to use orange, green, and gray for most of the website. We used the fonts that define the logo of the company. We used orange in header and green in the rest of the body of a webpage so that it contrasts well with the colors of the logo. 
Note: The name of the founder on the "ABOUT" page and the name of some of the dishes on the "MENU" page are fictional, in addition to the locations on the "LOCATIONS" page.
